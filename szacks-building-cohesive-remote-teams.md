A cohesive team consisting of average-skilled employees can easily outperform a non-cohesive group of superstars. 
This remains true no matter where team members are located. 
So in order to understand what's necessary for building cohesive remote teams, we must start with understanding what makes *any* team successfully cohesive—then determine the best ways to translate those practices and habits to a distributed environment.

In this chapter, I'll explain the following eight qualities that lead to cohesive teams:

- Understanding the team goals
- Relating to your teammates on a personal level
- Communication
- Diversity
- Regular feedback
- Effective retrospectives
- Celebrating success

Perhaps unsurprisingly, each one is in some way related to interpersonal relationships. 
And when team members think and act openly, each one of them improves.

To build a cohesive team, you have to work on all the aspects that surround work, though they are not necessarily part of the team's workload. 
Each one of these dimensions raises its own challenges when the team is working in a remote environment—and even more so when the team is distributed globally.

## Understanding the team goals
Everyone on a team has individual tasks to complete, but the more each member understands the bigger picture—the more they know what everyone else is doing, and why—the easier it will be to shift direction if they need to, and the easier it is to ensure that the solutions they're developing are the indeed the best solutions.

So how do team members discover others' goals? 

A team physically co-located together can derives a great deal of information through osmosis—overhearing spoken conversations, seeing what people are drawing on the whiteboard, and talking to people over a coffee or smoking break. 
They ask and answer questions, exchange valuable context, and their understanding of what the team is working on slowly emerges. 

Because remote team members don't always *see* other team members doing their work, they don't receive that osmotic information, and they aren't guided by as much natural curiosity. 
So a  remote team, must consciously plan to disseminate the information that'll pique curiosity.

However, being that the information isn't related directly to the work that each individual is dealing with, they may feel that it is irrelevant information. 
This has to be regularly reinforced, including tying each person's specific work to the team's goals and objectives. 
During meetings it is important to ask everyone who is giving a status to also relate to their work in terms of the larger objectives. 
This will help focus everyone on what the real mission is and not to get bogged down on the details of their specific tasks.

## Relating to your teammates on a personal level
Teams are comprised of individuals, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, even when they all can answer to the same job description. 
This allows the team to utilize each individual for the aspects that they can best contribute. 
One person may be better at external communication, another at learning new things quickly and a third at graphic arts. 
These attributes are often not advertised, but learned during personal interaction, such as coffee/smoking breaks, eating lunch together or going to the bar after work. 
In a remote environment, people are often given tasks appropriate to their professional profile, but not necessarily based on their personal ability.

As a member of a team, you often have to trust your teammates and understand what they mean when they say something. 
For example, if someone says "I'll have it done by tomorrow", that can mean a lot of different things, from a practical perspective. 
Some people will actually have it done on time, and if you ask them about it beforehand, they will consider that annoying. 
Other people need reminders and a bit of pushing, if you actually want it delivered as promised. 
It may be in perfect form at the promised date, or that might be the first rough draft.

You should know what is going on in their personal life. 
If they are expecting a new life event, such as getting married, having a baby or going through a hard time this can impact their work ethic. 
The more you know about your teammates, the more you will be prepared for anything they throw your way. 
Everyone has ups and downs and just like you can support your teammates when they are on a low, you can expect that they will support you when it comes around. 
Having a personal relationship with people in a remote/global environment can be more challenging, as you have to explicitly build the relationship instead of having it slowly develop implicitly by virtue of you working together.

Remote teams should schedule regular coffee breaks.
In this case, a "coffee break" is a block of time in which a few people get together on a video call for specifically non-business conversation. 
It might seem a bit contrived at first, but with time, it helps build and cement relationships. 
The team dynamic should guide exactly how it is implemented, either with set people each time, or a specific time when anyone who wants can join in. 
At the beginning, it may be necessary to choose a person to set the topic, though after the team becomes comfortable with one another, natural conversation may be more forthcoming. 
An important thing to remember is that this is still a business environment, and topics that are out of bounds should not be raised.	

## Communication
"The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said," Peter Drucker once noted.
There are multiple ways of communicating in a face to face environment. 
Tone, facial expressions and body language are just as important, if not more so, than the actual words used. 
Learning how your teammates convey ideas is critical in understanding what is being said. 
In the world of faceless communication, such as email and chat, there is so much innuendo that is lost. 
Sarcastic email replies often cause a lot of consternation as the recipient tries to understand the meaning of the email. 
While video conferencing mitigates some of this, it is still a long way from a face to face conversation.

Not all remote communication is equally effective. 
It can be ranked in the following order:

-   video conference
-   voice-only
-   instant message/chat
-   email

### Video Conference
The best form of remote communication is video conference. 
While it's not the same as standing next to someone, at least you can see the person, including their facial expressions. 
Do they look tired and exasperated or cheerful and playful. 
You can hear their voices and recognize the seriousness of their words or the sarcasm and cynicism. 
You can see that they are paying attention, as well as body language reactions to what is being said. 
Ask all participants to turn on their video cameras. 
Keep in mind that this may not be possible for everyone, as they may have low bandwidth concerns or other things going on in the background. 
When cameras are on, participants are engaged more as it is easier to see if they are concentrating on something else. 
Oftentimes, people tend to multitask when they know that nobody can see them.

### Voice communication
With voice communication, you lose the ability to see the participants and all the benefits mentioned above. 
However, you still get to hear the tone of voice, which includes any hesitations or uncertainties. 
In a meeting with multiple people, it is more difficult to know if everyone is fully engaged.

### Instant Messaging/Chat
Instant messaging or chat is interactive communication, though you may miss a lot of verbal and non-verbal clues. 
Emojis are often used to try and convey tone, and as such it is recommended to use them even in business conversation. 
You do have to be careful not to overuse them, and to keep the tone professional. 
While using chat, a lot of people tend to use informal jargon, such as "u" or "ur" instead of "you" and "your". 
Before doing this, you should set standards with your team as to what is considered acceptable communication. 
If you are chatting with people you don't normally work with, always use full spelling and complete sentences until such standards are established.

### Email
The worst form of communication is email. 
It is a unidirectional communication and very difficult to convey tone. 
Messages are often misunderstood and read in a different tone than the sender intended. 
When non-native speakers of the language are the recipients, colloquialisms can be very confusing. 
This is not to say that email shouldn't be used, it is a critical aspect of business communication. 
It is imperative to understand the limitations of email, and take that into consideration when sending. 
It is a good practice to have someone else review emails before they are sent when you have an expectation that they may be misunderstood.

## Diversity
Every person is unique and has their own way of looking at any situation. 
Everyone's perspective is generally colored by their life experiences, education, and neurodiverse cognitive patterns. 
A team composed of people with similar backgrounds will have a much narrower range of perspectives than a team made up of people with different backgrounds. 
This diversity enables the team to look at a situation through a multi-faceted lens, giving them a wider degree of understanding of the big picture.

Diversity is one of the few aspects of cohesive teams that is potentially stronger in a remote environment. 
Teams that are comprised of people from multiple backgrounds, countries and cultures have the ability to work together and increase the value they provide. 
A team that learns how to interact with each other and feed off of each other's strengths will be able to blend into a cohesive mesh.

## Regular Feedback
Feedback is a critical aspect in a team's ability to constantly improve. 
They have to understand what they are doing right, so that they can continue doing that as well as the mistakes they've made so that they can work on those issues. 
Feedback can come from multiple directions. 
Managers who see that there is a problem with people working together, can suggest methods of improvement. 
Teammates can make suggestions to each other regarding problems they've seen and suggestions on how to improve. 
Customers can provide feedback on what improvements will make their lives better.

When working with a remote team, this feedback loop becomes more difficult to manage. 
There are much fewer interactions between the team members, so they may not feel comfortable giving constructive criticism. 
Managers don't see the interactions and may not be aware that some of the team members are not working well together. 
The feedback loop has to become more of a structured process, than an informal discussion in the cafeteria.

To accomplish this, managers should have regular one on one meetings with each team member. 
Everyone should have a list of objectives, both task and career based. 
During these meetings, the manager should provide any feedback about the tasks the team member is responsible for. 
The team member should also be asked for feedback on the tasks, the manager and the team's general direction. 
This should be an open conversation, where the team member feels safe and that his opinions are valued. 
They should also look towards career goals and ensure that the team member is moving in the correct direction and getting the experience needed.

## Effective retrospectives
When a project reaches a milestone—or wraps up—it's generally a good idea to conduct a retrospective (or "post-mortem") to review what how the team succeeded on the project and how it may need to improve in the future. 
This involves analyze the _entire_ project process—both the "good" aspects as well as "bad." 
Teams are successful when they draw out their members' strengths while minimizing weaknesses; this process enables team members to provide feedback to their peers and for everyone to learn from one another.

In a remote environment, a retrospective should be a multi-step process that looks something like this:

-   Survey
-   Review & Follow-up
-   Meet & Discuss
-   Action Items

### Survey
Ask the participants to collaborate on writing questions to ask the team about the project. 
You want to make sure that everyone's ideas and concerns are taken into account and included. 
After the team agrees on the questions, they should be sent as a survey for everyone to answer. 
As much as possible, every question should be actionable - based on the answers, the process can be changed in the next project. 
When possible, questions should have fixed options as answers, either True/False or a small set of possibilities. 
This will enable you to generate statistics per answer. 
You also need a place for additional comments, so that everyone has the opportunity to provide their full feedback.
  
### Review
When all the survey results are complete, publish them for the entire team to see and review. 
Any questions about the results should be followed-up on so that you understand them. 
Everyone on the team should keep track of their own comments on each result.

### Meet & Discuss
After the individual review is complete, it is time for the meeting. 
Each question should be reviewed and the team should be asked for any thoughts or comments. 
The result of this should be a list, based on each question of aspects that should remain the same and those that should change in future projects.

### Action Items
The finalized list should be sent to the team for an additional review to gain final feedback before declaring the process complete.

## Celebrating success
Upon completing a successful project or process, it is a good idea to celebrate. 
This not only reinforces the positive aspects, but also enables the team to spend time together in an informal, positive manner. 
Going out for drinks or dinner after work, bringing in a cake or any other type of celebration brings the team closer. 
This enables the team to relive the victory and discuss future plans.

On a remote team, this is more challenging, as each team member is celebrating on their own. 
Consider beginning regular team meetings by asking members to share their appreciations. 
Each participant has the opportunity to give a shout-out to someone else on the team who did something positive. 
This peer-recognition is a great way to express appreciation and then the team that they are valued members. 
If the team has a budget for awards, the manager can have an "employee of the month" award or similar, for which the winner is sent a small token of appreciation, such as a "dinner for 2" coupon. 
If the team is in a similar time-zone, you can gather at the end of the day for a team drink together. 
While it isn't the same as actually going out, it is an informal after work together-type event. 
In teams that are globally dispersed this is not generally possible.
