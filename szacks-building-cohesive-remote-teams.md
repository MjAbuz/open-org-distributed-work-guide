A cohesive team consisting of average-skilled employees can easily outperform a non-cohesive group of superstars. 
This remains true no matter where team members are located. 
So in order to understand what's necessary for building cohesive remote teams, we must start with understanding what makes *any* team successfully cohesive—then determine the best ways to translate those practices and habits to a distributed environment.

In this chapter, I'll explain the following seven qualities that lead to cohesive teams:

- Understanding the team goals
- Informal interactions
- Knowing the whole person
- Communication
- Diversity
- Regular feedback
- Effective retrospectives
- Celebrating success

Perhaps unsurprisingly, each one is in some way related to interpersonal relationships. 
And when team members think and act openly, each one of them improves.

To build a cohesive team, you have to work on all the aspects that surround work, though they are not necessarily part of the team's workload. 
Each one of these dimensions raises its own challenges when the team is working in a remote environment—and even more so when the team is distributed globally.

## Understanding the team goals
Everyone on a team has individual tasks to complete. However, the more each member understands the bigger picture - what everyone else is doing, and why - the easier it will be to shift direction if they need to. It will also be easier to ensure that the solutions they're developing are indeed the best solutions (and the more opportunities they'll find to add unanticipated value to each other's work).

So how do team members discover others' goals? 

A team physically co-located can derive a great deal of information through osmosis—overhearing spoken conversations, seeing what people are drawing on the whiteboard, and talking to people over a coffee or smoking break. 
They can ask and answer questions, exchange valuable context, and their understanding of what the team is working on slowly emerges. 

Because remote team members don't always *see* other team members doing their work, they don't receive that osmotic information, and they aren't guided as much by natural curiosity. 
So a remote team must consciously plan to disseminate the information that'll pique curiosity.

However, since this kind of osmotic information isn't always directly related to the work that each person on a remote team is dealing with, certain members might feel it's irrelevant—and filter it out.
So teams need to deliberately reinforce osmotic information flows and constantly ensure that it's tying each person's specific work to the team's goals and objectives.
During meetings, for example, it's important to ask everyone providing a status to also relate to their work in terms of the team's broader objectives. 
This will help *everyone* focus on the team's joint mission, and not get bogged down on the details of their specific tasks.

## Informal interactions
In distributed organizations, people are often assigned tasks appropriate to their professional profiles—not necessarily based on their personal abilities.
So teams might not be able to infer the full extent of their teammates' talents and interests simply by observing the work they're doing. 
Therefore, creating ample opportunities for information interactions between distributed team members is essential to team cohesion.

First, doing this can help team members locate and draw out hidden talents on the team.
Teams are comprised of individuals, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, even when they all qualify for the same job description.
Remote teams—all teams, really—are successful when they draw out their members' strengths while minimizing weaknesses.
In this way, every team can tap individuals for the aspects of the work to which they can best contribute. 
One person may be better at external communication, another at learning new things quickly, and a third at graphic arts. 
These attributes might not be readily observable.
Rather, team members learn about them from one another through interpersonal interactions, perhaps while taking coffee/smoking breaks, eating lunch together, or going to the bar after work.

Fostering informal interactions on a distributed team is also important for helping that team collaborate more effectively.
In short, they're more likely to work better together when they understand and recognize one another more completely.
Here's one example of what I mean: As a member of a team, you often have to trust your teammates and understand what they mean when they say something. 
Someone who says "I'll have that done by tomorrow" might mean one of several different things by that sentence from a practical perspective. 
Some people will have it done on time (or before), and if you ask them about it beforehand, they will consider that annoying. 
Others need reminders and a bit of pushing if they're going to deliver the work to you as promised. 
On a distributed team, you'll only understand nuances like these if you've spent some time really getting to you know your teammates and understanding their personalities.
The more you know about your teammates, the more you will be prepared for anything they throw your way. 

Having a personal relationship with people in a remote/global environment can be more challenging, as you must explicitly build relationships instead of having them slowly develop organically by virtue of simply occupying the same physical location.
One strategy for fostering these relationships is schedukling regular coffee breaks.
In this case, a "coffee break" is a block of time in which a few people get together on a video call for specifically non-business conversation. 
It might seem a bit contrived at first, but with time, you'll find it helps build and cement interpersonal relationships. 

## Communication
In face-to-face environments, people have access to multiple means of communicating.
Tone, facial expressions, and body language are just as important (if not more so) than the words people use when interacting.
These channels are rich sources of meaning, and learning *how* your teammates convey ideas is critical to understanding what those teammates are saying.
("The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said," Peter Drucker once noted.)

Yet on distributed teams, faceless communication—facilitated perhaps with email or text chat—so much of that nuance can be lost.
And opportunities for misunderstanding can multiply.

Not all remote communication tools are equally effective. 
I would rank them in the following order of decreasing effectiveness:

- video conference
- voice-only communication
- instant message/chat
- email

### Video conference
The best form of remote communication is a video conference. 
While it can't quite replicate the experience of standing next to someone, it at least allows you to see the person you're talking to, including their facial expressions. 
You can hear their voices and recognize the either seriousness of their words or the sarcasm they're intended. 
You can see that they are paying attention, and you can monitor body-language reactions to what you're saying. 
So when possible, ask all participants to turn on their video cameras (just keep in mind that this may not be possible for everyone, as they may have low bandwidth concerns or other things going on in the background). 
When cameras are on, participants are engaged more as it is easier to see if they are concentrating on something else. 
Oftentimes, people tend to multitask when they know that nobody can see them.

### Voice-only communication
With voice-only communication, you lose the ability to see the participants and all the benefits mentioned above. 
However, you still get to hear the tone of voice, which includes any hesitations or uncertainties. 
And in a meeting with multiple people, knowing whether everyone is fully engaged becomes more difficult.

### Instant messaging/chat
Instant messaging or chat maintains synchronous communication, though you may miss many verbal and non-verbal cues you'd otherwise pick through audio and video. 
People often use emojis to convey tone, and as such it is recommended to use them even in business conversation. 
You do have to be careful not to overuse them, and to keep the tone professional. 
While using chat, many people tend to use informal jargon, such as "u" for "you" or "ur" for "your."
Before doing this, you should set standards with your team as to what is considered acceptable communication. 
If you are chatting with people you don't normally work with, always use full spelling and complete sentences until such standards are established.

### Email
The worst form of communication is email. 
It is a unidirectional communication and very difficult to convey tone. 
Messages are often misunderstood and read in a different tone than the sender intended. 
When non-native speakers of the language are the recipients, colloquialisms can be very confusing. 
This is not to say that email shouldn't be used, it is a critical aspect of business communication. 
It is imperative to understand the limitations of email, and take that into consideration when sending. 
It is a good practice to have someone else review emails before they are sent when you have an expectation that they may be misunderstood.

## Diversity
Every person is unique and has their own way of viewing and interpreting any situation. 
Everyone's perspective is generally colored by their life experiences, education, and neurodiverse cognitive patterns. 
A team composed of people with similar backgrounds will have a much narrower range of perspectives than a team made up of people with different backgrounds. 
This diversity enables the team to look at a situation through a multi-faceted lens, giving them a wider degree of understanding of the big picture.

Diversity is one of the few components of cohesive teams that is potentially *stronger* in a remote environment. 
That is, distributed teams can have members anywhere; teams comprised of people from multiple backgrounds, countries, and cultures have the ability to work together and increase the value they provide. 
A team whose members learn to interact with each other and feed off of each other's strengths will be able to blend into a cohesive mesh.

## Regular feedback
Feedback is a critical aspect in a team's ability to constantly improve. 
They have to understand what they are doing right, so that they can continue doing that as well as the mistakes they've made so that they can work on those issues. 
Feedback can come from multiple directions. 
Managers who see that there is a problem with people working together, can suggest methods of improvement. 
Teammates can make suggestions to each other regarding problems they've seen and suggestions on how to improve. 
Customers can provide feedback on what improvements will make their lives better.

When working with a remote team, this feedback loop becomes more difficult to manage. 
There are much fewer interactions between the team members, so they may not feel comfortable giving constructive criticism. 
Managers don't see the interactions and may not be aware that some of the team members are not working well together. 
The feedback loop has to become more of a structured process, than an informal discussion in the cafeteria.

To accomplish this, managers should have regular one on one meetings with each team member. 
Everyone should have a list of objectives, both task and career based. 
During these meetings, the manager should provide any feedback about the tasks the team member is responsible for. 
The team member should also be asked for feedback on the tasks, the manager and the team's general direction. 
This should be an open conversation, where the team member feels safe and that his opinions are valued. 
They should also look towards career goals and ensure that the team member is moving in the correct direction and getting the experience needed.

## Effective retrospectives
When a project reaches a milestone—or wraps up—it's generally a good idea to conduct a retrospective (or "post-mortem") to review what how the team succeeded on the project and how it may need to improve in the future. 
This involves analyze the _entire_ project process—both the "good" aspects as well as "bad." 
This process enables team members to provide feedback to their peers and for everyone to learn from one another.

In a remote environment, a retrospective should be a multi-step process that looks something like this:

- Survey
- Review & Follow-up
- Meet & Discuss
- Action Items

### Survey
Ask the participants to collaborate on writing questions to ask the team about the project. 
You want to make sure that everyone's ideas and concerns are taken into account and included. 
After the team agrees on the questions, they should be sent as a survey for everyone to answer. 
As much as possible, every question should be actionable - based on the answers, the process can be changed in the next project. 
When possible, questions should have fixed options as answers, either True/False or a small set of possibilities. 
This will enable you to generate statistics per answer. 
You also need a place for additional comments, so that everyone has the opportunity to provide their full feedback.
  
### Review
When all the survey results are complete, publish them for the entire team to see and review. 
Any questions about the results should be followed-up on so that you understand them. 
Everyone on the team should keep track of their own comments on each result.

### Meet & Discuss
After the individual review is complete, it is time for the meeting. 
Each question should be reviewed and the team should be asked for any thoughts or comments. 
The result of this should be a list, based on each question of aspects that should remain the same and those that should change in future projects.

### Action Items
The finalized list should be sent to the team for an additional review to gain final feedback before declaring the process complete.

## Celebrating success
Celebrate when the team successfully completes a project or process. 
Doing this not only reinforces a culture of positivity but also enables the team to spend time together, informally socializing. 

For co-located teams, this might involve going out for drinks or dinner after work, sharing a cake, or any other type of celebration brings the team closer. 
Moments like these enable the team to relive the victory and discuss future plans.

On a remote team, celebratory traditions like this are more challenging, as it can seem like members are celebrating on their own. 
To espouse a culture of positivity on a distributed team, consider beginning regular team meetings by asking members to share something they appreciate. 
This provides every participant the opportunity recognize someone else on the team who did something positive. 
This peer-recognition is a great way to reinforce every team member's value. 
If the team has a budget for awards, it might consider initiating something like a "member of the month" award (or similar), for which the winner is sent a small token of appreciation (like a restaurant gift certificate). 
And if every member of the team is working in the same (or closely aligned) time zones, the team might gather on a video call at the end of the work day and share a drink.
