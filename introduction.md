# Introduction: Why distributed work?

Why might an open organization be interested in distributed work?
Listing individual reasons could fill this entire guide.
Most organizations that choose a distributed work model don't do so for idealistic reasons; they do it because they see it as the best way to meet some organizational need.
Maybe it's to save money on the cost of renting, furnishing, and operating office space.
Maybe it's to improve hiring, whether by making relocation less expensive or becoming more attractive to members who can't or won't relocate.
Maybe it's to have greater resiliency in case of natural disaster, civil unrest, or any of the other calamities in your property insurance policy's fine print.
Whatever the reason, it's a choice an organization deliberately makes.

But what if history had unfolded differently, and the situation were reversed?

Just as organizations can "default to open," they could also "default to distributed."
Sure, some activities don't lend themselves ideally to distributed work.
Your neighborhood soup kitchen or hair salon may be shining beacons of openness, but the work that occurs there requires physical co-presence.
Fire fighters and surgeons (with some inspiring technological exceptions) can't do their jobs from across the country.

But why not make *those* the exceptional cases?

Let's start with the assumption that our work will be distributed and then make *centralization* the deliberate choice.
Distributed workers are not necessarily working from their home or their favorite coffee shop.
They're not necessarily working from remote reaches of the Antarctic.
It might be the case that the entire team is in your organization's offices—just not the same office.

## Why distributed work?

Wherever your organization's members are are, distributed work means meeting them there.
If you're not already convinced that defaulting to distributed is the right choice, consider the impact it has.
Distributed work [enables your organization to be more inclusive](https://opensource.com/open-organization/19/1/remote-work-inclusivity).
By freeing team members from geographic constraints, you show them they're valuable—not just that they're the best you could find within a reasonable commute distance.

And let's be clear: large organizations already function on a distributed work model, whether they realize it or not.
A company with tens of thousands employees—even if they're all on the same sprawling campus—are probably not doing most of their work face-to-face.
In a previous role, I worked for a company where a large percentage of the employees—and almost all of the ones I ever interacted with—spent their days in a 100-plus building corporate headquarters.
It was basically a city unto itself.
I worked from home, so when I made trips to headquarters, I made a concerted effort to attend meetings in person.

That's when I realized I was spending a quarter of my day traveling between buildings.
It was good for my step count, but it wasn't something that would be effective to do on a regular basis.
I realized that even with everyone in the same approximate physical location, we were a distributed company.
Cross-functional meetings, in particular, frequently had people joining via video conference from a building down the street.

The company was distributed, but it never acknowledged that.
For people like me who were fully-remote, it stood out.
Why, if we're already doing *de facto* distributed work, could the remote employee experience not be better?

## Why this book?

The idea that organizations are already reliant on distributed work without consciously acknowledging it is part of why we wrote this book.
Of course, there's also the organization that truly isn't distributed but wants to be.
And the organization that has embraced distributed work but wants to do better.
No matter where your organization falls, distributed work has become an undeniable fact of modern life.

Of course, distributed work is not without its challenges.
That's why we wrote this book.
It collects lessons from Open Organization contributors across the world and in a variety of industries.
We wrote it as a distributed work project, refining our ideas as we put them into practice.
As with so many things in life, it is not the Single Right Answer™.
Instead, it is a guide to help you find the answer that works best for your organization.

We start with a section on establishing trust.
Trust is always important, but even more so in distributed organizations where it's very difficult to stand at someone's desk and check on them.
Without trust, none of the rest of this book matters.

From there, we move into the functional aspects: communicating and collaborating.
Before you can work together to refine ideas, you must be able to share them.
This involves both the technology used for communicating and collaborating, as well as the social norms for how that technology is used.

In the fourth section, we build the community that the first three sections lay the foundation for.
This has two aspects.
The first is growing your organization, both in number and in effectiveness.
It also includes growing the bonds within your organization—helping people connect when they don't get to meet in physical space.

Lastly, we cover topics related to leading and managing distributed work teams.
Just as "traditional" management practices don't always fit an open organization model, distributed work requires a change in management approaches.

The ordering of these sections is intentional.
We wrote this book to reflect the journey that organizations take as they embrace distributed work.
After we put the order of the sections together, I realized the flow was reminiscent of [Tuckman's stages of group development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development).

Bruce Tuckman identified four inevitable and universal stages of group development: forming, storming, norming, and performing.
Forming—how teams come to be in the first place—is out of the scope of this book.
We assume you already have your team formed.
The first section on building trust fits well with the storming stage.
Storming, despite the name, doesn't require contentious arguments, but it is the stage where trust is built.

Sections two and three are the elements of the norming stage.
As the name indicates, this is where the team establishes and accepts norms.
The last two sections fit into Tuckman's performing stage.
This is where where the organization reaps the benefits of remote work.

## A work in progress

This book is a work in progress; what you're reading is only the first version.
In the spirit of open source, we chose to release early and release often.
As additional chapters are ready, we'll publish subsequent releases.
And of course, those future releases will also include "bug fixes"—typos and style corrections, yes, but also refinements to ideas.
We'll continue to learn from our experiences, each other, and you.

Your contributions will make this book an even more valuable resource to future readers.
We welcome your comments and suggestions.
Let us know what's missing.
What has worked, and what hasn't worked as your organization learns to embrace distributed work?
Development is happening on [GitHub](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-distributed-work-guide), so you can see the work as it happens and provide us with your feedback.
