# Introduction
Why might an organization be interested in distributed work?
Listing individual reasons could fill this entire guide.
Most organizations that choose a distributed work model don't do so for idealistic reasons; they do it because they see it as the best way to meet some organizational need.
Maybe it's to save money on the cost of renting, furnishing, and operating office space.
Maybe it's to improve hiring, whether by making relocation less expensive or becoming more attractive to members who can't or won't relocate.
Maybe it's to have greater resiliency in case of natural disaster, civil unrest, or any of the other calamities in your property insurance policy's fine print.
Whatever the reason, deciding to operate in a distributed manner involves a deliberate choice to "work differently."

But what if history had unfolded differently and all the events that led to co-located work becoming the "default" were reversed? Just as organizations can "default to open," they could also "default to distributed."

Sure, some activities don't lend themselves ideally to distributed work.
Your neighborhood soup kitchen or hair salon may be shining beacons of openness, but the work that occurs there requires physical co-presence.
Fire fighters and surgeons (with some inspiring technological exceptions) can't do their jobs from across the country.

But why not make *those* the exceptional cases?

Let's start with the assumption that our work will be distributed—and then make *centralization* the deliberate choice.
We might soon discover that distributed work is the rule, not the exception.

## Why distributed work?
After all, "distributed workers" aren't necessarily working from their homes or their favorite coffee shops.
They're not necessarily working from the remote reaches of the Antarctic.
Maybe your entire team is in your organization's offices—just not the same office.
Or maybe they *are* all in the same office—but they're separated by 14 floors, and gathering for a co-located meeting might take as long as the meeting itself.

A company with tens of thousands employees—even if they're all on the same sprawling campus—are probably not doing most of their work face-to-face.
In a previous role, for example I worked for a company where a large percentage of the employees—and almost everyone I interacted with there—spent their days in a corporate headquarters with more than 100 individual buildings.
It was basically a city unto itself.
I worked from home, so when I made trips to headquarters, I made a concerted effort to attend meetings in person.
That's when I noticed I was spending a quarter of my day simply traveling between buildings.
It was good for my step count, but it wasn't something that would be efficient if done on a regular basis.
Even with everyone in the same approximate physical location, I realized *we were a distributed company*.
We just never acknowledged that.

Wherever your organization's members are, distributed work means meeting them there.
If you're not already convinced that defaulting to distributed is the right choice, consider the impact it has.
Distributed work [enables your organization to be more inclusive](https://opensource.com/open-organization/19/1/remote-work-inclusivity).
By freeing team members from geographic constraints, you show them they're valuable—not just that they're the best you could find within a reasonable commute distance.
So if we're already doing *de facto* distributed work, why could the remote employee experience not be better?

## Why this book?
The idea that organizations are already reliant on distributed work processes and practice—even if they aren't consciously acknowledging it—is partly of why we wrote this book.
Of course, we also recognize  the organization that truly isn't distributed but wants (or needs) to be.
And we acknowledge the organization that has embraced distributed work but wants to be better at it.
Since distributed work has become an undeniable fact of modern life, your organization is going to fall into at least *one* of these categories.

Distributed work is not without its challenges, of course.
That's the *primary* reason we wrote this book, which collects lessons from Open Organization community contributors across the world and in a variety of industries.
We wrote (and continue to write) the book as a distributed work project, refining our ideas as we put them into practice.
As with so many things in life, it is not the Single Right Answer™.
Instead, it's a guide to help you find the answer that works best for *your* organization.

We begin with a section on establishing trust.
Trust is important in *any* organizational context, but it's even more critical in distributed organizations where standing at someone's desk and checking on them is rather difficult (if not impossible).
Trust—between teammates, between individual contributors and their managers, and between leaders across the distributed organization—is paramount to success in a distributed context.
Without trust, the rest of what's in this book doesn't matter.

From there, we move into the more functional aspects of distributed work: communicating and collaborating.
Before you can work together to refine ideas, you must be able to share them.
This involves not only the *technology* you use for communicating and collaborating but also *the social norms* for *how* you use that technology.

In the fourth section, we build the community for which the first three sections lay a foundation.
Two aspects of community are important to distributed organizations.
**// I'm not sure what line 66 means. Can you help readers understand more specifically what you're suggesting? —BB//**
The first is growing your organization, both in number and in effectiveness.
It also includes growing the bonds within your organization—helping people connect when they don't get to meet in physical space.

Lastly, we cover topics related to leading and managing distributed work teams.
Just as "traditional" management practices don't always fit an open organization model, distributed work requires a change in management approaches.

We've ordered these sections intentionally, as we've designed this book to reflect the journey that organizations undertake as they embrace distributed work.
Seasoned practitioners will recognize that journey as one that follows [Tuckman's stages of group development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development).
Bruce Tuckman identified four inevitable and universal stages of group development: forming, storming, norming, and performing.
Forming—how teams come to be in the first place—is out of the scope of this book (if you're reading this book, then we assume you've alreadyformed your team).
For distributed teams, building trust is integral to the "storming" stage of group development.
Despite its name, storming doesn't require contentious arguments, but it *is* the stage where trust gets built.
Sections on communication and collaboration speak to elements of the "norming" stage.
As the name indicates, this is where the team establishes and accepts norms.
And the last two sections reflect activities that occur in Tuckman's "performing" stage.
This is where where the organization truly begins reaping the benefits of remote work.

## A work in progress
This book is a work in progress; what you're reading is only the first version.
In the spirit of open source, we chose to release early and release often.
As additional chapters are ready, we'll publish subsequent releases.
And of course, those future releases will also include "bug fixes"—typos and style corrections, yes, but also refinements to ideas.
We'll continue to learn from our experiences, each other, and you.

Your contributions will make this book an even more valuable resource to future readers.
We welcome your comments and suggestions.
Let us know what's missing.
What has worked, and what hasn't worked as your organization learns to embrace distributed work?
Development is happening on [GitHub](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-distributed-work-guide), so you can see the work as it occurs and provide us with your feedback—or, even better, your own contribution.
