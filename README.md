# The Open Organization Guide to Distributed Teamwork
(Working title!)  
A community-produced guide to open principles and practices that enhance distributed, remote teamwork

## About the guide

Distributed organizations are more common than they've ever been. And the challenges to working together at a distance have never been more pressing. Across all industries and geographies, teams are rethinking how they operate—and questioning fundamental assumptions about the nature of work. In this guide, we’ll explore how adopting open principles and practices—the same ones that have guided open source software communities across decades of innovation-at-a-distance—can assist remote, distributed teams grappling with their own remote work challenges.

How can highly distributed teams collaborate on industry-shaping innovations when they’re scattered across the world? How can they make decisions, take action, and hold one another accountable when they’re working in different places, and at different times? How do they achieve communication and ensure equitable relationships when they aren’t co-present? How do they maintain their passion and engagement when they haven’t seen one another for weeks, months, or years? Open organizational principles—like transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community—can catalyze high-performing teams anywhere, even (perhaps especially) when their members are far apart.

This guide offers remote, distributed teams (those working remotely for the first time, as well as those with extensive remote-work experience) a guide to the open principles and practices essential for building dynamic, inclusive, high-performing teams—no matter where their members happen to be.
